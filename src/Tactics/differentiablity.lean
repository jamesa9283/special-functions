`differentiability` solves goals of the form `differentiable f` by applying lemmas tagged with the
`differentiability` user attribute.

I have no idea what it does, I just stole Reid's code and changed a few things.

You can also use `differentiability!`, which applies lemmas with `{ md := semireducible }`.
The default behaviour is more conservative, and only unfolds `reducible` definitions
when attempting to match lemmas with the goal.

`differentiability?` reports back the proof term it found.
